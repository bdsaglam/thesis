  abstract        = {The aim of this paper is to give an overview of domain adaptation and
                     transfer learning with a specific view on visual applications. After a general
                     motivation, we first position domain adaptation in the larger transfer learning
                     problem. Second, we try to address and analyze briefly the state-of-the-art
                     methods for different types of scenarios, first describing the historical
                     shallow methods, addressing both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous domain
                     adaptation methods. Third, we discuss the effect of the success of deep
                     convolutional architectures which led to new type of domain adaptation methods
                     that integrate the adaptation within the deep architecture. Fourth, we overview
                     the methods that go beyond image categorization, such as object detection or
                     image segmentation, video analyses or learning visual attributes. Finally, we
                     conclude the paper with a section where we relate domain adaptation to other
                     machine learning solutions.},
