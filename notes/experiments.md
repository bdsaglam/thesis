target domain B

### Domain shift 
Represent domain shift as image features extracted from CLIP for all data points.


## Domain adaptation on CLIP 

### Baseline
Hand-crafted prompt describing domain B.
It may not work well because it's been shown that the prompt engineering is difficult and unintuitive.

### Learnable prompt
